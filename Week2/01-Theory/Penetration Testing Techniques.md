**2. Penetration Testing Techniques**

While studying penetration testing, I learned that it goes beyond just identifying vulnerabilities it focuses on actively exploiting them to understand the real world risks to a system. This makes it a more comprehensive way of assessing security than scanning alone, since it demonstrates how an attacker could move through different stages of an attack.

**Core Concepts I Learned**

**Phases of Penetration Testing:**
I explored the structured phases of a penetration test. Reconnaissance (for example, using OSINT tools like Shodan) allows me to gather information about the target. Scanning (e.g. using Nmap or Nessus) helps in identifying open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities. Exploitation is the stage where I attempt to leverage those weaknesses, often with tools like Metasploit, to gain access. Post-exploitation, on the other hand, focuses on maintaining access, escalating privileges, and collecting evidence. Finally, the reporting phase is essential to document findings and suggest fixes.

**Testing Methodologies:**
I also studied recognized frameworks such as the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) and OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG). PTES provides a clear structure for scoping and executing pentests, while OWASP WSTG is more web-application focused. Learning these methodologies helped me understand how to follow a professional and ethical process.

**Ethics and Scope:**

One important takeaway was the need to always conduct penetration testing within a defined scope and with explicit client authorization. This ensures that the test remains legal, controlled, and aligned with the client’s needs.

**Key Takeaways**

From this study, I realized that penetration testing is not just about “hacking” but about following a professional, ethical, and structured process. My main lessons include:
•	Always defining the scope and objectives before testing.
•	Following clear methodologies such as PTES or OWASP WSTG.
•	Demonstrating real-world risks by moving beyond scans into controlled exploitation.
•	Documenting findings clearly to support remediation.

**Learning Resources**

To deepen my understanding, I studied the PTES documentation, which describes each penetration testing phase in detail. I also reviewed the OWASP WSTG to learn methodologies specific to web applications. Additionally, I looked at SANS penetration testing case studies, which provided real-world insights into how professional pentesters conduct assessments.
