1. Vulnerability Scanning Techniques.

While working on this topic, I learned that vulnerability scanning is one of the most important steps in assessing the security posture of a system. It helps identify weaknesses that attackers could exploit, and I explored different approaches to achieve this.
Core Concepts I Learned

•	Scan Types:
I discovered that network scans (using tools like Nmap) allow me to detect open ports and services such as SSH, HTTP, or SQL, which gives a baseline understanding of what is exposed. On the other hand, application scans (e.g using Nikto) are focused on web applications and can reveal issues like outdated libraries, misconfigurations, or injection flaws. I also learned the difference between authenticated and unauthenticated scans: authenticated scans provide deeper insights by logging into the system with valid credentials, whereas unauthenticated scans simulate an external attacker’s perspective with no access.

•	Vulnerability Scoring:
I studied the CVSS v4.0 system, which assigns a severity score from 0–10. For instance, a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability with a score of 8.8 is considered High. A real example is the Apache Struts (CVE-2017-5638) vulnerability, which was marked as Critical and famously exploited in the Equifax breach.

•	False Positives:
I understood that scanners sometimes report risks that are not actually exploitable. For example, an open port might show as vulnerable, but manual verification is always needed to confirm the result. This highlighted to me the importance of not relying solely on automated tools.

Key Takeaways

From this study, I realized the importance of:
•	Configuring scans properly and validating results for accurate risk assessment.
•	Using CVSS scoring to prioritize vulnerabilities that pose the highest risk.
•	Reducing false positives by cross-checking findings with multiple tools and manual checks.

Learning Resources
To deepen my understanding, I reviewed the OWASP Testing Guide for web scanning methodologies, and NIST SP 800-115, which provides standardized scanning practices. I also analyzed the WannaCry ransomware case, where attackers exploited SMB vulnerabilities rated as Critical in CVSS, showing how dangerous unpatched systems can be
