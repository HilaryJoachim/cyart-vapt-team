**3. Exploit Development Basics**

While studying exploit development, I learned that it focuses on turning software vulnerabilities into practical attacks. Unlike scanning or pentesting alone, exploit development requires a deeper understanding of how systems work internally, including memory, processes, and mitigations. This knowledge helps me see how attackers craft exploits and how defenders can design protections.

**Core Concepts I Learned**

**Vulnerability Types:**
I explored common categories of vulnerabilities that can lead to exploitation. For example, buffer overflows occur when programs fail to check input sizes, allowing attackers to overwrite memory and hijack execution flow. I also learned about SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), which are more application-layer exploits targeting input validation flaws.

**Exploit Writing:**
I studied how to take a proof-of-concept vulnerability and develop it into a working exploit. For example, using Python to write a script that triggers a buffer overflow, or using Metasploit’s msfvenom to craft a reverse shell payload. I also learned that published exploits from Exploit-DB often serve as templates to understand exploit structure.
Mitigations:
I realized that modern systems use protections such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), Data Execution Prevention (DEP), and Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). While these make exploitation harder, attackers often develop bypass techniques, which shows the importance of layered defenses.

**Key Takeaways**
From this study, I understood that:

•	Exploits are built on deep technical knowledge of vulnerabilities and system internals.

•	Writing even simple exploits requires safe practice in isolated labs.

•	Defenses like ASLR and DEP exist to reduce the success of exploits, but attackers continuously look for ways around them.

**Learning Resources**
To strengthen my understanding, I studied proof-of-concept exploits on Exploit-DB, which helped me see how vulnerabilities are weaponized. I also explored TCM Security’s exploit development guides. A notable case study I reviewed was EternalBlue (MS17-010), which was weaponized into the WannaCry ransomware showing how powerful exploit development can be when vulnerabilities are left unpatched.
