## **Evidence Collection**

`# Capture traffic`  
`sudo wireshark &`

`# Save exploit logs`  
`sessions -l`  
`sessions -i 1`  
`sysinfo`

Generate file hashes:

`sha256sum exploit_log.txt`  
`sha256sum traffic_capture.pcap`

## **Remediation & Verification**

* Patch **Drupal** to the latest version.

* Harden server permissions.

* Re-run OpenVAS scan:

`gvm-cli socket --xml "<start_task><task_id>TASK_ID</task_id></start_task>"`

**PTES Report Draft (200 words)**

**Executive Summary**  
 I conducted a penetration test against the target system (Kioptrix/Drupal-based VM). The engagement followed PTES methodology, covering reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation. The objective was to assess system resilience, demonstrate real attack vectors, and provide remediation guidance.

**Findings**  
 OpenVAS identified a critical vulnerability in Drupal (CVE-2018-7600, “Drupalgeddon”). Using Metasploit, I successfully obtained remote code execution and gained a Meterpreter shell. Post-exploitation activities confirmed attacker access to system commands, network configuration, and potential lateral movement opportunities.

**Recommendations**  
Apply security patches immediately (upgrade to supported Drupal versions). Restrict network exposure to administrative panels. Implement Web Application Firewalls (WAF). Conduct regular patch management, periodic VAPT, and monitor system logs. Re-scanning post-remediation confirmed the vulnerability was closed, improving security posture significantly

## **Non-Technical Briefing (100 words)**

During testing, I identified a critical flaw in the target’s web application. This weakness allowed me to gain full control of the system, just as a real attacker could. If exploited in production, it would risk sensitive data, disrupt services, and damage organizational trust. To address this, I recommend applying the latest patches, strengthening access controls, and deploying monitoring tools. After fixes were applied, a verification scan confirmed the vulnerability was resolved. This process improved the organization’s defenses and demonstrated the importance of regular penetration testing as part of a strong cybersecurity strategy.
